## What is deployKF?

> <a href="https://www.deploykf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>deployKF</strong></a> helps you build world-class data and machine learning platforms on __any Kubernetes cluster__, in any cloud or environment.
> 
> Our vision is that __anyone with Kubernetes experience__ can effortlessly build and support a _custom data and machine learning platform_ for their organization, without requiring specialized MLOps knowledge.

## Why use deployKF?

> By combining the _ease of a managed service_ with the flexibility of a self-hosted solution; 
> deployKF creates a platform tailored to your organization's needs, while not also requiring a team of MLOps experts to build and maintain it.
> 
> The key features of deployKF are:
> 
> - Runs on __any Kubernetes__, including on-premises and in the cloud
> - Support for leading __Data and MLOps tools__ including [__Kubeflow__](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/tools/#kubeflow-ecosystem), [__Airflow__](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/future-tools/#apache-airflow)<sup>†</sup>, and [__MLflow__](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/future-tools/#mlflow-model-registry)<sup>†</sup>
> - Intuitive [__centralized configs__](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/deploykf-values/) to manage all aspects of the platform
> - Seamless __in-place upgrades__ and config rollouts
> - Connect with __existing services__ like Istio and cert-manager, [S3](https://www.deploykf.org/guides/tools/external-object-store/), and [MySQL](https://www.deploykf.org/guides/tools/external-mysql/).
> - Native support for __GitOps__ via ArgoCD
> 
> <sub><sup>†</sup><sup>Coming soon, see our [current](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/tools/) and [future](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/future-tools/) tools.</sup></sub>
